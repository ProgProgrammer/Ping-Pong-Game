AS002. Add separate classes Paddle, Ball, PauseMessage and World.
AS003. IDEA: Add class Controller to get control action independent (from keybord, from user, from net).
	- Controller is a part of class World(Server).
	- Client send to server commands like paddleUp or paddleDown.
	- World(Server) calculate position of all objects and send it back to Client.
	- Controller equale to Client. Client should be NET client, Bot or set of Keyboard keys.
    - World(Server) should know anything about window or any detals of realisation.
    IMPLEMENTING_STEPS:
        - Split World(Server) from Window
